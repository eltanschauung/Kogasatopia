# SourceMod Include Policy

Each plugin must include only the APIs it directly uses. Do not copy a universal include block between plugins.

## Include categories

1. SourceMod/core includes: `sourcemod`, `clientprefs`, `dbi`, `files`, `textparse`, `geoip`, `basecomm`.
2. SDK/TF2 includes: `sdktools`, `sdkhooks`, `sdktools_sound`, `sdktools_gamerules`, `tf2`, `tf2_stocks`, `tf2utils`.
3. Public plugin API includes: `points_store_api`, `clans_api`, `saysounds`, `dgm_api`, etc.
4. Repo-private helper includes: `database.inc`, `steam_identity.inc`.
5. Fragile/extension includes: `dhooks`, `sourcescramble`, `socket`, `nativevotes`, `tf2items`, `tf2attributes`, `tf_custom_attributes`, `scattergun_pellets`.

## Include order

Use this order at the top of every `.sp` file:

1. `#pragma semicolon 1`
2. `#pragma newdecls required`
3. SourceMod/core includes
4. SDK/engine includes
5. TF2 includes
6. Required third-party APIs
7. Optional plugin APIs
8. Optional extensions
9. Repo-private helpers
10. Local implementation fragments

## Optional dependencies

Optional plugin APIs must be wrapped narrowly:

```sourcepawn
#undef REQUIRE_PLUGIN
#include <some_api>
#define REQUIRE_PLUGIN
```

Optional extensions must be wrapped narrowly:

```sourcepawn
#undef REQUIRE_EXTENSIONS
#include <some_extension>
#define REQUIRE_EXTENSIONS
```

Every optional native that may be called must be marked with `MarkNativeAsOptional` in `AskPluginLoad2` and guarded at runtime.

## Public APIs

If one plugin exposes natives that another plugin calls, those native declarations belong in `scripting/include/<name>_api.inc`.

Do not manually declare another plugin's natives inside a `.sp` file except as a temporary migration step.

## Local helpers

Repo-private stock/helper includes should be named for their responsibility, have include guards, and avoid declaring plugin natives.

## Large plugins

Large integration plugins may have large include blocks, but only when each dependency is actually used. These files should not be copied as templates for smaller plugins.

## Statistics timestamps

The public `plugin_statistics.inc` API defers statistics writes to the Rust provider and exposes its observed and expected tickrate values. The provider stamps Unix epoch timestamps, map-session context, and tickrate fields.

## Current layout

```text
scripting/include/
  Public plugin APIs: *_api.inc, saysounds.inc, amplifier.inc, conch_no_speed.inc
  Repo-private helpers: database.inc, steam_identity.inc, client_validation.inc, buildings.inc, tf2_classes.inc, item_indexes.inc
  Public statistics API: plugin_statistics.inc
  Legacy / to migrate: addplayerhealth.inc
